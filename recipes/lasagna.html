    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish that has become a beloved comfort food worldwide. Originating from the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy, 
        lasagna is a hearty casserole that layers wide, flat pasta sheets with a rich meat sauce, creamy béchamel, 
        and a generous amount of cheese. The key to a great lasagna lies in its sauce, typically a slow-cooked ragu 
        made with ground meat, tomatoes, onions, and garlic, which is simmered to perfection to develop deep, 
        savory flavors. The alternating layers of pasta, sauce, and cheese are baked until bubbly and golden,
        creating a dish that's both indulgent and satisfying.</p>

    <p>Beyond its traditional roots, lasagna has inspired countless variations to suit different tastes and dietary needs. 
        Vegetarian versions often replace the meat with a variety of vegetables like spinach, 
        zucchini, and mushrooms, while still maintaining the essential layers of pasta, tomato sauce, 
        and cheese. There are also lasagnas that use alternative ingredients like gluten-free pasta or dairy-free 
        cheese to accommodate specific dietary restrictions. Whether enjoyed in its classic form or as a creative twist, 
        lasagna remains a versatile and universally loved dish that brings people together around the table.</p>
