    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chicken Alfredo is a rich and creamy pasta dish that has become a favorite comfort food for many. Originating from Rome, 
        this dish combines fettuccine pasta with a creamy Alfredo sauce made from butter, heavy cream, and Parmesan cheese. 
        The addition of tender, pan-seared chicken breasts makes it a hearty and satisfying meal.</p>
    <p>The key to a great Chicken Alfredo lies in the sauce, which should be smooth, rich, and cheesy. Freshly grated Parmesan 
        cheese melts into the cream and butter to create a velvety sauce that coats the pasta and chicken perfectly. 
        For an added touch, you can include garlic, black pepper, and a sprinkle of parsley to enhance the flavor.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts</li>
        <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>Salt and black pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 pound fettuccine pasta</li>
        <li>Chopped parsley, for garnish</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Season the chicken breasts with salt and black pepper. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and cook until golden brown and cooked through, about 5-7 minutes per side. Remove the chicken from the skillet and set aside.</li>
        <li>In the same skillet, add the minced garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the butter and heavy cream, stirring until the butter is melted and the mixture is well combined.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to low and gradually whisk in the Parmesan cheese until the sauce is smooth and creamy. Season with additional salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, cook the fettuccine pasta according to package instructions. Drain and add the pasta to the skillet with the Alfredo sauce. Toss to coat the pasta evenly with the sauce.</li>
        <li>Slice the cooked chicken and serve on top of the Alfredo pasta. Garnish with chopped parsley and additional Parmesan cheese, if desired. Serve immediately.</li>
